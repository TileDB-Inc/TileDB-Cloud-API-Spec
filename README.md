## Using Swagger Definition

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a specification for defining API endpoints.
The swagger file can be used for visualizing the api via
[online swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) . There also is a large
number of tools which can take the swagger file and produce
working client code (code gen).
